<h1 title="">AYENBITE OF INWYT.
<br /><span class="smaller">(REMORSE OF CONSCIENCE.)</span></h1>
<h3>THE PROLOGUE.</h3>
<p>Almighty God gave ten behests in the law of the Jews,
that Moses received in the hill of Sinai in two tables of
stone, that were written with God&rsquo;s finger. And (Moses)
himself, after his burial, commanded in his story to each
man that will be saved to keep and observe them. And
whoso sinneth in any of the same behests, shall repent
thereof, and be shriven, and pray for God&rsquo;s mercy, if he will
be saved.</p>
<p>This book is written for Englishmen, that they may know
how they shall shrive themselves and make them clean in
this life. This book is called by him who writes <span class="sc">Ayenbite
of Inwyt</span>. First are the ten behests that all men shall
observe.</p>
<h3>THE FIRST COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The first behest that God made and commanded is this:
&lsquo;Thou shalt not have many gods;&rsquo; that is to say, &lsquo;Thou
shalt neither have, nor worship, nor serve any God but Me.
And thou shalt not put thy trust but in Me.&rsquo; For the same
that puts his trust chiefly in a creature, sinneth deadly and
acts against this behest. Such are they that worship the
idols and make their god of a creature, whatsoever it be.</p>
<p>Against this behest sin those that love their goods too
much, gold or silver, or other earthly things. Whosoever
sin in these things set their heart and their hope so much
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
that they forget their Creator, and forsake Him who lends
them all these goods. And therefore they should serve and
thank, and love and worship Him above all things, as this
first behest teaches thee.</p>
<h3>THE SECOND COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The second behest is as follows: &lsquo;Thou shalt not take
God&rsquo;s name in vain;&rsquo; that is to say, &lsquo;Thou shalt not swear
for naught and without good reason,&rsquo; which our Lord Himself
forbids us in His Gospel, that one should not swear,
neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by other creature.
Yet from good cause one may swear without sin, as
in judgment, where one demands oath of truth, or out of
judgment from other good cause, and with purity and
reason. In no other manner is it right to swear. And,
therefore, whosoever swears without reason the name of our
Lord, and for naught, if he wittingly swears false he
forswears himself, and acts against this behest, and swears
deadly, for he swears against conscience, that is to say
(understand), when he forswears himself by thought and by
long thinking. But he that swears true wittingly, and
always for naught or for some bad reason, not wickedly, but
lightly and without slander, swears venially. Nevertheless
the habit is sinful, and may well turn to deadly sin unless
he beware. But he that swears horribly by God or by His
saints, and breaks him in pieces, and says slanders about
him that are not to be said, the same sins deadly. Nor can
he have reason, that he may excuse himself. And he that
accustoms himself to swear most, sins most.</p>
<h3>THE THIRD COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The third behest is this: &lsquo;Look that thou hallow the day
of the sabbath (Saturday),&rsquo; that is to say, thou shalt not
do on the day of the sabbath (Saturday) thy business, nor
thy works, that thou mightest do on other days. But thou
shalt rest thyself in order the better to prepare thyself to
pray to and to serve thy Creator, who rested the seventh
day from works that He had made in the six days before, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
which He made and ordained (ordered) the world. This
behest he spiritually fulfils who keeps by his might the
peace of his conscience, in order to serve God more holily.
Then this word &lsquo;Saturday,&rsquo; which the Jews call &lsquo;sabbath,&rsquo;
signifies (as much as) rest.</p>
<p>This behest can none keep spiritually, that is conscious
(in conscience) of deadly sin. For such conscience cannot
be at rest the while that she is in such a state. And instead
of the sabbath, which was strictly kept in the old law,
holy Church sets the Sunday to be kept in the new law, for
our Lord arose from death to life on Sunday. And therefore
one shall beware and keep free so holily, and be at
rest, from works over and above the week; and more from
works of sin; and give himself more to spiritual works and
to God&rsquo;s service, and think on his Creator, and pray to Him,
and thank Him for His goodness. And whoso breaks the
Sunday and the other high feasts that are ordained to be
kept in holy Church, sins deadly, for he acts against the
aforesaid behest of God and of holy Church, except it be for
some business that holy Church allows. But he sins more
that spends the Sunday and the feasts in sin, and in whoredom,
and in other sins against God. These three behests
direct us specially to God.</p>
<h3>THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The fourth behest is this: &lsquo;Honour thy father and thy
mother, for thou shalt live the longer on the earth.&rsquo; This
behest admonishes us that we beware that we anger not
father nor mother wittingly. And whoso despises his father
and his mother wittingly, or slanders them, or angers with
evil, sins deadly, and breaks this behest.</p>
<p>In this same behest is understood the honour that we
shall bear to our spiritual fathers, that is, to them that
have the care of teaching us and of chastising us, such as
are the rulers of holy Church, and those that have the care
of our souls and of our bodies. And whoso will not bow
to them that have the care of him, when they teach the
good that one is bound to do, sins deadly; and the disobedience
may be such that it is deadly sin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3>THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The fifth behest is this: &lsquo;Thou shalt slay no man.&rsquo; This
behest forbids that one shall slay another for revenge, or
for his goods, or for other wicked reason, for that is deadly
sin. Nevertheless to slay evildoers, in order to do and
keep right, and for other good reason, (it) is good right by
the law to him that shall do it and is bound thereto.</p>
<p>In this behest is forbidden sin of hate, and of wrath,
and of great ire. For, as saith the Scripture, he that hateth
his brother, he is a man-slayer as to his will, and sins
deadly; and he (also) that bears long wrath against others;
for such wrath, long held and befolded in the heart, is in
wrath and in hate, which is deadly sin and against this
behest. And yet sins he more that does or purchases
shame or harm to others wrongfully, or is in counsel and in
help to cause others to be harmed in order to avenge himself.
Nevertheless wrath or contempt, that goes lightly
without great will and willingness to harm others, is not
deadly sin.</p>
<h3>THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The sixth behest is this: &lsquo;Thou shalt do no whoredom;&rsquo;
that is to say, thou shalt not desire carnal fellowship with
other men&rsquo;s wives.</p>
<p>In this behest is forbidden us all sin of the flesh, that
one calls generally lechery. That is one of the seven
deadly sins, though there are some branches that are not
deadly sin, as are many motions of the flesh, all of which one
cannot flee. And those one shall bring to naught and withdraw
from as much as one can, not nourish nor pursue them,
either by too much meat or drink, or by evil thoughts too
long holden, or by evil handlings. For in such things one
may have harm of soul. In this behest is forbidden all sins
against nature, in whatever manner they are done, either
in his own body or in others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3>THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The seventh behest is this: &lsquo;Thou shalt do no theft.&rsquo;
This behest forbids us to take and withhold other men&rsquo;s
thing, whatever it be, from wicked cause, against the will
of him that owns it.</p>
<p>In this behest is forbidden robbery, theft, stealing, and
usury, and unfair dealing with others, in order to have for
his own. And he that acts against this behest is bound to
give up what he has wrongly of other men&rsquo;s, if he knows
to whom. And if he knows not, he is bound to give it for
God&rsquo;s love, or to act by the advice of holy Church. And he
that wrongly withholds other men&rsquo;s thing for a sinful reason
sins deadly, unless he give it up, where he owes, if he
knows it and can do it, or unless he acts by the advice of
holy Church.</p>
<h3>THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The eighth behest is this: &lsquo;Thou shalt say no false
witness against thy fellow-Christian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this behest it is forbidden us that we should lie or
forswear ourselves, either in judgment or out of judgment,
in order to cause thy fellow-Christian harm; and that one
should bring none as a witness in order to impair his (one&rsquo;s
fellow-Christian&rsquo;s) fame, or his grace that he hath, for that
is deadly sin. Against this behest those act that slander
good men behind them willingly and wrongfully, which one
calls the sin of detraction; and those also that praise the
wicked and the deeds of their wickedness and of their
follies, known, or seen, or heard. That is sin of flattery or
of deceit, when one says it before them; or falsehood or
leasings, when he that one speaks of is not present. For
all those are false witnesses.</p>
<h3>THE NINTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The ninth behest is this: &lsquo;Thou shalt not desire thy
neighbour&rsquo;s wife, nor desire her in thy heart.&rsquo; That is to
say, thou shalt not consent to do sin with thy body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>This behest forbids to desire with will of heart to have
carnal fellowship with all women out of marriage; and the
sinful tokens that are made outwardly in order to lead to
sin, as are sinful words of such a kind, or gifts, or sinful
handling. And the difference between this behest and the
sixth aforesaid is, that the sixth behest forbids the deed
without, but this forbids the consent within. For the consent
to have carnal fellowship with a woman (women), who
is not his own for a wife, is deadly sin by the judgment of
God&rsquo;s Word, which says: &lsquo;Whoever sees a woman and
desires her in his heart, he hath sinned with her in his
heart,&rsquo; that is to say, in open desire and in thought.</p>
<h3>THE TENTH COMMANDMENT.</h3>
<p>The tenth behest is this: &lsquo;Thou shalt not desire a thing
that is thy neighbour&rsquo;s.&rsquo; This behest forbids the will to
have other men&rsquo;s thing(s) for a wicked reason.</p>
<p>In this behest is forbidden envy of other men&rsquo;s goods, or
of other men&rsquo;s grace. For the same envy comes of sinful
covetousness to have the goods or the very grace that he
sees in others. And the same covetousness, when the consent
and the thoughts [are] thereto, is deadly sin, and
against this behest. Nevertheless light covetousness to
have other men&rsquo;s things for a good reason is no sin. And
if there is any evil desire, without will and without consent
to harm others, it is no sin; and if there is sin, it is light
sin.</p>
<p>These are the ten behests, whereof the three first direct
us well to God; the other seven direct us to our neighbour.
These ten behests are incumbent on each one that hath
reason and age, to know and to do. For whoever acts
thereagainst wittingly, sins deadly.</p>
<h3>THE TWELVE ARTICLES OF THE CHRISTIAN BELIEF.</h3>
<p>These are the twelve articles of the Christian belief, that
each Christian man shall believe steadfastly, for otherwise
he cannot be saved when he hath wit and reason. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
thereof are twelve according to the numbers of the twelve
apostles, who appointed them to be observed and to be kept
by all those that will be saved. The first, then, belongs to
the Father, the next seven (seventh) to the Son, the last
four (fourth) to the Holy Ghost; for that is the beginning
of the belief, &lsquo;believe in the Holy Trinity;&rsquo; that is, in the
Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost, one God
and three persons. All these articles are contained in the
creed, that the twelve apostles made, whereof each ordained
his own.</p>
<p>The first article is this: &lsquo;I believe in God, the Father
Almighty, Creator of heaven and of earth.&rsquo; This article
St. Peter ordained.</p>
<p>The second article belongs to the Son, as to His Godhead;
that is to say, that He is God, and is this: &lsquo;I believe
in Jesus Christ, our Lord, the Son of God the Father, and
(He) is one with the Father in all things that appertain to
the Godhead, but, with regard to the person, who is other
than the person of the Father.&rsquo; This article St. John the
Evangelist ordained.</p>
<p>The third article and the fifth, that follows after, belong
to the Son as to His manhood; that is to say, as He is
mortal man. Then in the third article is contained, that
He was conceived of the Holy Ghost, and born of the maid
Mary. By which it is to be understood that He was conceived
in the maid Mary by the deed and by the virtue of
the Holy Ghost, and not at all by deed of man. And the
maid Mary remained ever maid and whole before and after.
This article St. James, St. John&rsquo;s brother, ordained.</p>
<p>The fourth article belongs to His passion; that is to
say, that He suffered death under Pontius Pilate, who was
a pagan, and judge at that time in Jerusalem, by the
Romans. Under that judge was Jesus Christ condemned
wrongfully at the command of three wicked Jews, and
crucified, and dead, and placed in a tomb. This article St.
Andrew ordained.</p>
<p>The fifth article is as follows: that He went into hell
after His death, in order to lead out thence and to deliver
the souls of the holy fathers, and of all those that, from the
beginning of the world, died in true and good belief, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
in hope that they should be saved by Him, because of the
sin of the first man. It behoved that all should go into
hell and abide there, the good in sure hope that Jesus
Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, should come to deliver them, according
as He had promised by His prophets. And for that reason
would He after His death go into hell, that is to say, on
that side where the saints were, not on that side where
were the lost, who were dead in their sin and in their
unbelief. And those He led not out, for they are lost for
evermore. This article St. Philip ordained.</p>
<p>The sixth article is of His resurrection, to wit, that the
third day after His death, in order to fulfil the Scriptures,
He arose from death to life, and showed Himself to His
disciples, and proved His resurrection to them in many
ways for forty days. This article St. Thomas ordained.</p>
<p>The seventh article is, that the fortieth day after His
resurrection, when He had eaten with His disciples, He
ascended before them quite openly into heaven, who is
above every creature that is in heaven, unto the right hand
of God the Father, where He made Him [sit]. This article
St. Bartholomew ordained.</p>
<p>The eighth article is, that He shall come at the day of
judgment to judge the dead and the living, the good and
the bad, and render to each according as he hath deserved
in this world. These are the articles that belong to the
Son. This article St. Matthew, the evangelist, ordained.</p>
<p>The ninth article and the three last belong to the Holy
Ghost, and is this: &lsquo;I believe in the Holy Ghost.&rsquo; This
article requires that one believe that the Holy Ghost is the
gift and love of the Father and of the Son, from whom
comes all the good of grace, and that He is one God, and
one with the Father and the Son, except the person, which
is other than the person of the Father and of the Son.
This article St. James, St. Simon&rsquo;s and St. Jude&rsquo;s brother,
ordained.</p>
<p>The tenth article is this: &lsquo;I believe (in) the holy
Catholic Church and the communion of saints;&rsquo; that is to
say, the fellowship of all the saints, and of all the good
men that are, and shall be unto the end of the world, and
were since the beginning, together in the faith of Jesus
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Christ. And in this article are understood the seven
sacraments that are in holy Church, to wit, christening,
confirming, the sacrament of the altar, orders, marriage,
the holy shrift, and the last anointing. This article St.
Simon ordained.</p>
<p>The eleventh is, to believe the forgiveness of sins, that
God gives by the virtue of His holy sacraments that are in
holy Church. This article St. Jude ordained.</p>
<p>The twelfth article is, to believe the general resurrection
of the body, and the life without end, that is the bliss of
Paradise, which God shall give to them that have deserved
it by good faith and by good works. This article gives
(us) to understand its contrary, that is, the torment
without end that God hath prepared for the lost. This
article shall be understood in such a manner, that each, be
he good, be he bad, shall be at the day of judgment raised
from death to life in his own body, wherein he shall have
[lived], and receive his reward in body and in soul, according
as he has deserved in this life. And therefore shall
the good at that day in body and in soul be in life
without end, and the wicked lost evermore in body and in
soul. This article St. Matthew ordained.</p>
<h3>OF THE REVELATION THAT ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST SAW.</h3>
<p>My lord, St. John, in the book of his visions, which is
called the Apocalypse, so says that he saw a beast that
came out of the sea wonderfully adorned and exceedingly
dreadful. For the body of the beast was as a leopard, the
feet were of a bear, the throat of a lion, and it had seven
heads and ten horns, and upon the ten horns ten crowns;
and St. John saw that the same evil beast had power of
himself to fight with the saints, and to overcome and to
overmaster them. This same beast, so wonderful and so
counterfeited and dreadful, betokens the devil, who came
out of the sea of hell, which is full of all sorrow and of all
bitterness. The body of the beast, as St. John says, was
so like the leopard because, as the leopard hath divers
colours, so hath the devil divers modes of watching and of
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
dispute, in order to beguile and to tempt folk. The feet
were like the feet of a bear, for as the bear, which hath its
strength in its feet and in its arms, holds strongly and binds
what it hath under its feet, what it embraces, just so does
the devil them that he hath embraced and overthrown by
sin. The throat was of a lion, because of his great cruelty,
that will devour all.</p>
<h3>THE TOKENS OF THE HEADS OF THE BEASTS.</h3>
<p>The seven heads of the beast of hell are the seven capital
sins by which the devil draws to himself also all the world.
For scarcely it befalls that one falls not into the throat of
some of the seven heads, and therefore St. John says well
that it had power against the saints. For on earth is no
man so holy that he can perfectly escape all the kinds of
sin that come of these seven heads without special privilege
of grace, as it was in the maid Mary, or in some others by
special grace, which they had of God. The ten horns of
the beast betoken the offences against the ten behests of
our Lord, which the devil obtains, as much as he can, by
the seven aforesaid sins. The ten crowns above betoken
the victory that it (he) hath over all the sinful, because he
causes them to sin against the ten behests.</p>
<h3>THE FIRST HEAD OF THE BEAST.</h3>
<p>The first head of the beast of hell is pride; the second is
envy; the third, wrath; the fourth, sloth, which one calls
in book-lore, indolence; the fifth, itching&mdash;in book-lore,
avarice, or covetousness; the sixth, gluttony; the seventh,
lechery, or luxury. Of these seven heads comes every
kind of sin, and therefore they are called capital sins,
because they are the head of all evil and of all sins, and
the beginning of all evil, be they deadly, be they venial.
Then each of the same seven divides into many divisions,
and first we will talk of the sin of pride, because that was
the first sin and the beginning of all evil. For pride first
broke fellowship and order, when Lightbearer (Lucifer) the
angel, because of his great beauty and his great wit, would
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
be above the other angels, and would make himself equal to
God, who had made him so fair and so good, and therefore
he fell from heaven and became a devil, both he and all
his fellowship. All the proud, who fellowship and order of
men destroy and break, are like him, when they will be
above others, and be more famed and praised than any
other that are more worthy.</p>
<h3>THE MIGHT OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>This sin of pride is too dreadful, for it (she) blinds men,
so that they themselves neither know nor see; it is a very
strong and a very special aid to the devil, whereby he beguiles
the high men, and the fair, and the rich, and the
wise, and the hardy, and the honourable, and generally
every manner of folk, but especially the great lords, so that
they themselves neither know nor see their misdeeds, nor
their follies, nor their faults (<i>read</i> wytes); then is it the
most perilous sickness of (all) others. Forsooth he is in
great peril, to whom every remedy turns into venom, as
do teaching and chastisement to the proud. For the more
one reproves and blames and chastises him the more angry
he is and the more weary he becomes.</p>
<p>Pride is the devil&rsquo;s own daughter, who has a great share
in his nature. Pride wars against God because of His
goodness, and God throws down pride and wars against it.
Pride is king of wicked habits. It (she) is the lion that
devours all. Pride destroys all the goodness and all the
graces and all the good works that are in man. For pride
makes of alms sin, and of virtues vices, and by good works,
whereby one should buy heaven, it makes us win hell.</p>
<p>This sin is the first that assails the knight our Lord,
(and) whom it is the last to leave, for when He hath all
other evils overcome, then pride assails Him the more
strongly.</p>
<h3>HOW ONE SHALL DIVIDE THE SEVEN BOUGHS OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>This sin divides and spreads into so many parts that one
can scarcely reckon them. But seven principal divisions
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
there are, which are as seven boughs, which go out, and are
born of a wicked root.</p>
<p>The first bough, then, of pride is untruth; the second,
contempt; the third, overweening, which we call presumption;
the fourth, over-boldness, which we call ambition;
the fifth, vainglory; the sixth, hypocrisy; the seventh,
wicked dread. To these seven divisions belong all the sins
that are born of pride. But each of these seven boughs
has many small twigs.</p>
<p>The first bough of pride, which is untruth, divides itself
into three little boughs, whereof the first is bad, the second
worse, the third worst of all. The one is crime, the second
madness, the third apostasy. Crime generally is in every
sin, for no sin is without crime, and so begin all sins by
crime. But the crime that we speak of here specially,
which comes of pride, is a kind of untruth, is a vice, that is
called in book-lore ingratitude; that is, forgetfulness of God
and of His gifts, that one thanks Him not as one should
do, nor yields Him thanks for His gifts that He hath
given us.</p>
<p>Forsooth, he is indeed a villain and untrue towards his
Lord, who hath done him all good, and he does not thank
Him, but forgets, and yields Him evil for good, and villainy
for courtesy. The same villainy doth man to God when he
bethinks him not of the gifts that God hath given him, and
gives him always, and thanks Him not, but rather often
opposes Him in that which he uses wickedly and against
God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>That is very great villainy, as it appears to me, that he
(should) receive great goodness and not deign to say great
thanks. And yet it is greater when one forsakes Him, or
when one forgets Him. But the same is too great, when
each day he receives the goodnesses, and each day yields
evil for good.</p>
<p>He then that thinks well, and often considers the gifts
which God hath given him, and gives always, and that he
has no good thing which God has not given him, neither
gifts of nature, as fairness and health and strength of body,
and sleight and natural wit as regards the soul; nor gifts of
chance, as riches, honour, and nobility; nor gifts of grace,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
as are virtues and good works, well should he thank God
for all His good things; for one goodness demands another.</p>
<p>The second untruth that comes of pride is madness.
One holds a man mad who is out of his wits, in whom
reason is gone astray. Then the same grows right foolish
and gone astray and well called mad, that wittingly and
boldly the goods, that are not his but his Lord&rsquo;s goods&mdash;whereof
it behoves him strictly to yield reckoning and
account, to wit, the goods of such great price and the
temporal goods that he hath in custody, the virtues of the
body, and the thoughts, and the consents, and the wills of
the souls&mdash;wastes and spends in follies and in excesses
before the eyes of his Lord, and provides not for his reckoning
and knows well that it behoves him to reckon, and
knows not when, neither the day nor the hour. Such folly
is well called witlessness. Of such vices the great proud
men are full, that use wickedly the great goods that God
has lent them.</p>
<p>The third untruth that comes of pride is apostasy. He
is indeed an apostate that puts the land that he holds of
his Lord into the hand of the enemy, and does him homage.
Such sin makes him who sins mortal, for then, as much as
in him lies, he does homage to the devil, and becomes his
thrall, and yields him all that he holds of God, both body
and soul and other good things, which he places at the
service of the devil. And although he be by his saying a
Christian, he denies by deed and shows that he is not. But
especially in three ways, is a man called an apostate and
false Christian, either because he believes not what he should,
as does the Bulgar, and the heretic, and the apostate, who
deny their belief; or because he sins against the belief that
he believes, as do the perjured and the liars of the belief;
or believes more than he should, as do the diviners and the
witches and the sorceresses, who work by the devil&rsquo;s power.
And all those that in such things believe and put their
trust, sin deadly. For all such things are against the
belief, and therefore holy Church forbids them. These are
the kinds of untruth, which is the first bough of pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3>THE SECOND BOUGH OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>The second bough that comes out of the stock of pride
(so) is contempt (despite), which is a very great sin. And
though it be so, that no deadly sin is without contempt of
God, always by that which we here specially call contempt,
by this sin one may sin in three ways: either
because one praises not others aright in heart as one
should, or because one shows not honour and reverence
where one should, or because one obeys not aright them
that one should rightfully obey.</p>
<p>Now, think right well in thy heart how often thou hast
done the same sin that thou hast in thy heart, despisest
those that are more worthy than thou because of some
external graces that God hath given thee, either because of
nobility, or prowess, or riches, or wisdom, or fairness, or
other gifts, whatever they may be; wherefore thou praisest
thyself more than thou shouldst, and others less.</p>
<p>Afterwards, think how many times thou hast shown
little honour and reverence to whom thou shouldst (have
shown them); first to God, and to His mother, and to His
saints, and to the angels of heaven. For there is none
against whom thou hast not sinned in contempt (despite),
or by the contempt that thou hast oftentimes evilly and
badly kept their feasts.</p>
<p>After that, think how many times thou hast misserved
our Lord Jesu Christ, either in this, that thou hast not joyfully
heard His service, nor said His prayers, nor heard
sermons; and when thou shouldst hear His mass or His
sermon at church, thou chatteredst and jestedst before
God, and in that thou showedst Him little honour.</p>
<p>Afterwards (think) how thou hast many times shown little
honour to the body of Jesu Christ when thou sawest it or
when thou receivedst it, in that thou wast not worthily prepared
by shrift and by repenting, or perchance, what is
worse, that thou wittingly receivest in deadly sin, which is
great contempt (despite).</p>
<p>Afterwards, to thy sweet fellow, and to thy good
guardian, thine angel, who always guards thee: how many
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
shames thou hast done him, in that thou didst thy sins
before him.</p>
<p>Afterwards, think how many times thou hast been disobedient
to thy father and to thy mother, and to those to
whom thou shouldst be obedient and show honour. If
thou wilt in this manner call to mind thy life, thou shalt
see that thou hast sinned more times in such kind of pride
as is called contempt (despite) than (that not) thou canst
reckon.</p>
<h3>THE THIRD BOUGH OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>The third bough of pride is arrogance, which one calls
overweening or presumption, when the man thinks more
of himself than he should; that is to say, that thinks he is
worth more than he is, or that he can do more than he can,
or that he knows more than he does, or thinks that he is
worth more, or more able, or more knowing than any other.
This sin is the strength of the devil, for it protects and
nourishes all the great spiritual sins. This sin shows
itself in many ways, either by deed or by speech, but
especially in six ways; to wit, in singularity, for the proud
and the presumptuous thinks that he is more worthy and
knows more than any others, and deigns not to do as others
that are more worthy than he is, but rather will be singular
in his deeds. That is the first sin by which overweening is
(shown) in deed.</p>
<p>The second is foolish undertaking of great expense,
which one calls prodigality, when he doth too much spending,
either of his own or of other men&rsquo;s, in order to be
praised, and therefore that one should hold him (to be) the
more liberal and the more courteous.</p>
<p>The third evil that comes of overweening is foolish undertaking
of false strife, as Solomon says; that is to say, whoever
takes a false strife in hand, and knows well that it is
false, and follows it.</p>
<p>The fourth twig of the same bough, whereby the proud
shows the pride of his heart, is boasting, which is a very
foul sin both to God and to the world. The boaster is the
cuckoo, which cannot sing, but of himself. This sin is
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
found (bound) in him who by his own mouth boasts, either
of his wit, or of his kin, or of his works, or of his prowess.
But it (the sin) doubles itself in those whom the boaster and
the liar seeks, and counsels, and gives them of his own, for
them to praise and to say of him (them) what he (they)
dare not say, and to lie concerning him (them), and to
boast his (their) nobility.</p>
<p>The fifth offshoot of the same stock is scorn. For that is
the wont of the proud overweener, that it is not enough for
him to despise in his heart the others that have not the
graces that he thinks he has, but makes his mockings and
his scorns, and, what is worse, mocks and scorns the good
men, and (of) those that he sees turn to good, which is very
great sin and very dreadful. But by their evil tongues they
turn aside much folk from doing well.</p>
<p>The sixth offshoot of the same bough is withstanding.
That is when the man withstands all them that would do
him good. For the proud overweener, if one reproves him,
he excuses himself, if one chastens him he is wroth, if one
advises him well he believes none but his own wit. It is a
perilous sickness when one cannot endure that one may
teach him, and to whom all medicines turn into venom.</p>
<h3>THE FOURTH BOUGH OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>The fourth bough of pride is foolish desire, which one
calls in book-learning ambition; that is, an evil desire to
climb high. This sin is the devil&rsquo;s pan of hell, wherein he
makes his fryings. This bough spreads in many ways right
and left. For he that desires to climb high, (to) some he
will please, and therefrom grow many sins, as on the right
hand to wit, deceit, simulation, giving foolishly, in order
that one shall esteem him courteous and liberal. (To)
others he will harm, and therefrom comes the sin on the
left side, as to slander them whom he will harm in order to
exalt himself, and raises up blame for him and desires the
death of that (man), who holds what he weens to come
into, and frauds, and evil counsel, conspiracies, strife, and
many other sins, that grow out of this evil bough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h3>THE FIFTH BOUGH OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>The fifth bough of pride is idle bliss; that is, foolish
liking of foolish praise, when he feels in his heart knowingly
that he is, or weens to be, praised for something that
he has in him, or weens to have, and will be praised therefore,
for which he should praise God. And therefore idle
bliss robs God, and steals what is His. For of all our
goods He shall have the honour and the praise, and we the
gain.</p>
<p>Idle bliss is the great wind that throws down the great
towers and the high steeples, and throws to the ground the
great beeches in woods, and makes the great hills to quake,
which are the high men and (those) that are most worthy.
That is the devil&rsquo;s penny, wherewith he buys all the fair
pennyworths in the market of this world, which are the
good works. And because there are three kinds of goods
that man hath of God, and that the devil wall buy with
his pence, therefore this bough divides into three kinds of
small boughs, whereof grows every kind of sin, which no
clerk can tell. The same three kinds of goods that one has
of God are the gifts of nature, the gifts of hap, the gifts of
grace. The natural gifts are those that one calls &lsquo;by
nature,&rsquo; either as to the body or as to the soul; as regards the
body, as health, fairness, strength, prowess, nobility, good
tongue, good speech; as regards the soul, as clear wit to
understand well, and subtle wit to devise well, good
memory to retain well, and the virtues of nature, whereby
one is more natural than another, or more liberal, or
meeker, or more gracious, or contented and well ordered.
For all these gifts one shall thank and serve God, because
they all come from Him. Nevertheless the proud sells them
to the devil for the false penny of idle bliss, and often wars
against God for all His gifts, for which he should thank
God. And whoever takes good heed [may see that] in all
these gifts of nature that I have briefly told, it is sin by
idle bliss in too many ways, which each may better see in
himself, if he will study well, than others can tell him.</p>
<p>The gifts of hap are exalted stations, riches, delights, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
prosperities, whereof one thinks in many ways. For when
the lady of hap has turned her wheel to the man, and raised
and set (him) to the height of her wheel, like the mill to
the wind, and (he has) climbed high there, there blow all
the twelve winds of idle bliss. For when he that is arisen
so high in prosperity thinks in his heart first of the dignity,
afterwards of his prosperity, after that of his riches, afterwards
of his lusts that his body has, after that of the great
fellowship that follows him, afterwards of the fair company
that serves him, after that of his fair manner, afterwards of
his fair ridings, afterwards of the plenty of fair robes, after
that of the adorning of his house with lustful ease and
other kinds of equipment, (so) that so much is fair and
noble, afterwards of the great presents and of the great
feasts that one makes him everywhere, after that of his
good fame, and of his praises, that fly everywhere. Thus
the wretch rejoices and glories in his heart, so that he
knows not where he is. These are the gifts that come of
idle bliss, (that is) to wit, twelve kinds of temptation of idle
bliss, which those in high estate have, either in the world or
in religion, either cleric or layman.</p>
<p>The gifts of grace are virtues and good works. And
against these gifts idle bliss often blows the more strongly,
and often fells the great trees and the highest, which are
the best men. And [thou] shalt know that in virtues and
in good works the devil tempts by idle bliss in three ways.
The one is within in the heart, when one hears of the good
things that one does privily, as of prayers or of privy
works, and the man thinks that he is better with God than
he is. The second is when he has a foolish bliss in him
because he hears or sees of his good renown, and that he
is praised and holden for a good man. The third is when
he desires and seeks and obtains fame and renown, and in
such understanding doth his good deeds, not for God
properly, but for the world.</p>
<h3>THE SIXTH BOUGH OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>The sixth bough of pride is hypocrisy, which is a sin
that makes one show the good without that is not within.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Those, then, are hypocrites who pretend to be good men
and are not, who pretend to have more strength than
name of good man, than truth and holiness. And this
(bough) divides (herself) in three. For there is an
hypocrisy foul, and another foolish, and the third subtle.
Those are foul hypocrites who do their foul deeds in corners
and show themselves good before the people. Such our
Lord calls painted and gilded sepulchres. Those are foolish
hypocrites who keep themselves cleanly enough as regards
the body, and do many and good penances principally
for the fame of the world, because one holds them to be
good men. Those are indeed fools, for of good metal they
make false money. Those are subtle hypocrites who
subtlely will climb up and steal the dignities and the
kingdoms. They do all that a good man shall do, so that no
man can know them until (then that) they are full grown
and climbed high in dignities. And then show they the
evils that were hidden and rooted in the heart, to wit,
pride, avarice, malice, and other evil deeds, whereby one
knows openly that the tree never was good, and that it was
all deceit and hypocrisy, all that he had before showed.
Therefore it is truly said: &lsquo;Thou shalt never know what
man is, until he is where he wishes to be.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>THE SEVENTH BOUGH OF PRIDE.</h3>
<p>The seventh bough of pride is foolish dread and foolish
shame, when one ceases to do well because of the world,
that one be not held a hypocrite or a canter, where one
dreads the world more than God. The same shame comes
of sinful pleasing, by which one wishes to please the sinful.
And therefore chiefly is she daughter of pride and the
seventh bough, and often makes (men) cease to do the
good and do the evil, in order sinfully to please the
world.</p>
<h3>THE SECOND HEAD OF THE BEAST OF HELL.</h3>
<p>The second head of the wicked beast is envy, which is
the adder that poisons all. Envy is mother to death, for
by the envy of the devil came death into the world; it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
the sin which most immediately makes man like the devil
his father. For the devil hates not but others&rsquo; good, and
loves not but others&rsquo; harm, and so does the envious. The
envious man cannot see the good of others, any more than
the owl or the bat (can see) the brightness of the sun.
The same sin divides chiefly into three boughs. For the
same sin envenoms first of all the heart of the envious, and
afterwards the mouth, and afterwards the works. The
heart of the envious is envenomed and goes astray, so that
he cannot see other men&rsquo;s good without repenting within
his heart and judging evilly, and what he sees or what he
hears takes it in a bad sense, and of all makes (his) harm,
so much (so) that to the heart of the envious [come]
venomous thoughts of false judgment, that one cannot tell
(them). Afterwards, when the envious hears or sees other
men&rsquo;s ill, whatever it be, either ill of body, as death or
sickness, or ill of chance (hap), as poverty or adversity, or
spiritual ill, as when he hears that some, that one held
good men, are blamed for some vice. At such things he
rejoices in his heart. Afterwards, when he sees or hears
the good of others, be it good of nature, or good of hap, or
good of grace, whereof we have spoken above, then there
comes a sorrow to his heart, so that he cannot be at rest,
nor make gladness, nor fair pretence. Now, thou canst
see that the venomous heart of the envious sins generally
in three ways: in false judgments, in wicked gladness,
in worse sorrows; he sins also by the mouth. For it
behoves that such wine as there is in the tun should run
by the tap. And because the heart was full of venom,
it behoves that it leap out by the mouth. Then from
the mouth of the envious come out three kinds of
venomous words, whereof David speaks in the Psalter,
&lsquo;The mouth of the envious is full of cursing, and of bitterness,
and of treason.&rsquo; Of cursing, for the goods of others
he defames, and depreciates them as much as he can.
Of bitterness, for the ills of others he exaggerates and
increases according to his might. Of treason, for all that
he sees or hears, he turns it to ill and judges it falsely.
Afterwards, the envious has three kinds of venom indeed,
as he hath in mouth and in heart; for the nature of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
envious is to withdraw and destroy all good by his might,
be it little, be it less, be it perfected. He is then of the
nature of the basilisk, for no greenness can last before him,
either in grass, or in bush, or in tree. Then, according to
the Gospel, corn has three states, for it is first as in grass,
afterwards in the ear, afterwards is full of fruit and quite
ripe. And so there are some that have a good beginning,
in order to live well and to profit, and are as in grass; the
same the envious takes pains to quench if he can. Others
are as in the ear, which flowers well in goodness and by it
is profitable to God or to the world; and the envious rebels
in order to confound and to destroy those by his might.
The others are perfect and in great state, and do much
good to God and to the world. Their good fame to abate
and their goodness to depreciate the envious prepares all
his devices. For the greater that the goodness is, the
more the envious sorrows. This sin is so perilous, that one
can scarcely come to right repentance, because it (she) is
contrary to the Holy Ghost, who is the well of all good.
And God says in His Gospel, that whoever sins against the
Holy Ghost (he) shall never have mercy in this world nor
in the other, for he sins of his own wickedness, and one
must in that wholly understand (it so). For there is no
sin so great that God does not forgive in this world, if man
repents and prays for mercy for the sin, that wars by its
might against the grace of the Holy Ghost, in that it wars
against other men&rsquo;s spiritual good, as the Jews opposed
Jesu Christ for the good things that He did.</p>
<h3>THE SINS AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST.</h3>
<p>And thou shalt know that there are six sins that are
specially against the Holy Ghost; to wit, overweening,
which makes the mercy of our Lord spread too much, and
praises His righteousness little, and therefore many people
sin in hope. The second is despair, which robs God of His
mercy, as overweening (does) of His righteousness. The
third is withstanding, that is, hardness of heart, when man
is hardened in his wickedness, so that one cannot turn him,
and he will not amend. The fourth is contempt of
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
penance; that is, when man ordains in his heart that he
shall not repent of his sin. The fifth is to oppose the
grace of the Holy Ghost in others. The sixth is to oppose
truth wittingly, and especially the truth of the Christian
belief. All these sins are against the goodness of the
Holy Ghost, and are so great that (they) hardly come to
right repentance, and therefore hardly are they forgiven.</p>
<h3>THE THIRD HEAD OF THE EVIL BEAST.</h3>
<p>The third head of the beast is hate. But thou shalt
know that there is one hate, which is virtue, which the
good man hath against evil; another, which is very great
sin, that is fierceness of heart, wherefrom come many
boughs, and chiefly four, (which) are the four wars that the
felon hath. The first is with himself, for when man bears
(him) hate to the torment (<i>read</i> of) soul and body, so that
man cannot sleep nor have any rest, sometimes it deprives
him of meat and drink and makes him fall into a fever, or
into such sorrow that he receives death. That is a fire that
wastes all the goods of the house. The second war that the
felon hath is with God. For wrath and felony so support
and seize sometimes the heart of the fierce one, because
of some temporal adversity, or sickness, or death of friends,
or some misfortune, when his will is not done, that he
murmurs against our Lord, and thanks God ill and His
saints, and swears and blasphemes against God and His
saints. The third war that the wrathful hath is with those
that are under him, that is, with his wife and with his
household; for the man is sometimes so out of his wits
that he beats and smites both wife and children and household,
and breaks pots and cups as if he were out of his wits;
and so he is. The fourth is war outside with his neighbours
and with his nearest, that are all about him. And from
this bough grow seven small boughs. For when wrath
arises between two men there is first chiding, and then
wrath that remains in the heart, afterwards wrath, afterwards
strife often comes, afterwards desire of vengeance,
afterwards sometimes manslaughter, and afterwards sometimes
deadly war between the friends, whereof often comes
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
too much evil, and perils that cannot be amended. For
when there is war between two men, it often befalls that
there are many people dead who have no guilt, churches
broken down, towns burnt up, abbeys, priories, barns
destroyed, and men and women and children disinherited
and exiled, and lands destroyed, and too much other harm,
which is done by reason of those who are bound to amend
what this brings, both the lord and all those that are helping
him (them), and (concerned) in such a business, and
therefore they are in great peril of their health of soul, for
they may not be able to amend or give up the harm that
they have done, and it behoves them to give it up or to be
hanged.</p>
<h3>THE FOURTH HEAD OF THE EVIL BEAST OF HELL.</h3>
<p>The fourth head of the wicked beast is sloth, that is,
idleness and disinclination to do well. This sin is too evil
a root, that casts many evil boughs. This idleness, which is
sloth, makes a man have evil beginning, and more evil
amending, and worse ending. Evil beginning has the
slothful through six sins. The first is thinness, when the
man loves our Lord little and lukewarmly, whom he should
love ardently, and therefrom it comes that he is feeble and
lukewarm to do all good things. The second is timidity,
that is, disinclination of heart, which is the devil&rsquo;s bed,
wherein he rests himself, and says to the man and to the
woman: &lsquo;Thou hast been too softly drawn forth, thou art
too feeble in constitution, thou canst not do the great
penances, thou art too tender, thou wouldst very soon be
dead;&rsquo; and therefore the wretch lets himself fall to do the
lusts of his flesh. The third is idleness, which is a sin that
causes much evil, as says the Scripture. For when the
devil finds the man idle he puts him to work, and causes
him first to think evil, and afterwards to desire villainies,
ribaldries, lecheries, and to lose his time and many good
things that he might do, whereby he might win paradise.
The fourth is heaviness, when the man is so heavy that he
loveth not but to lie and rest and sleep: sometimes they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
necessarily so long (enough) awake, that they had rather
lose four masses than a sweat or a sleep. The fifth is wickedness,
that is when the man lies in sin, and feels the temptations
of the devil and of his flesh that assail him, and
through downright wickedness will not raise the head to God
in sorrow, nor cry &lsquo;Harou!&rsquo; (Norman cry for assistance)
in shrift, nor raise the hands in satisfaction (amends). The
same is like the wretch that would rather rot in a foul and
stinking prison than have the torment of steps to climb for
his outgoing. The sixth is little will (inertness). In this
sin are those that have dread for naught, that dare not
begin to do well because they have dread that God will fail
them, which is the dread of the dreamers who have dread
of their dreams. They are like him that dare not go in the
path because of the snail which shows him his horns, and
like the child that dare not go his way because of the goose
that blows.</p>
<p>These are the six vices that rob the man of good beginning.
Because of six other vices the slothful cannot have
good beginning or amendment. They are the bad habits of
an evil servant, who causes that no good man shall receive
him (them) into his service when he is so slothful, untrue,
careless, forgetful, slack, and failing. The first vice is untruth.
For when God sets in the heart of man goodwill to
do well, then comes the devil and says to him: &lsquo;Thou
shalt easily recover it; thou art young and strong; thou
shalt live long,&rsquo; and so the devil makes him to cease from
doing well. Afterwards comes sloth; for he that does well
and does it delayingly, it is no wonder if he does it slothfully.
That is a vice whereby all the world is besmutted,
(as) whoever takes good heed [may see]. For few folk
there are that are diligent in what they are bound to do as
regards God and their neighbour.</p>
<p>After sloth is forgetting. For whoever is slothful often
forgets. Because of these two sins of forgetting it often
befalls that he cannot be shriven; he forgets his shortcomings
and his sins, which is great peril. For none can
have forgiveness without true shrift, which produces repentance
of heart, confession of mouth, obedience in deed;
that is, amending and reparation. There is no man so good
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
that, if he saw well his own shortcomings, would not find
enough to say each day in his shrift. But sloth and forgetting
make the sinners blind, so that they see not in the
book of their conscience.</p>
<h3>THE PERIL OF SLACKNESS.</h3>
<p>Afterwards comes slackness, which comes of want of
heart, and of evil habit, which so binds the man that with
difficulty he gives himself to well-doing. Sometimes it
comes of ignorance and of foolish heat, whereby the man so
starves his heart and his body by fasts and by vigils and by
other deeds, that he falls into feebleness and into such sickness
that he cannot labour in God&rsquo;s service, and perishes in
the slackness because he has neither taste nor devotion for
well-doing. Afterwards comes weariness, which makes the
man become weary and worse from day to day, until he is
quite defeated and overcome with weariness. And this is
the sixth vice of the evil servant, that he fails ere he come
to the end or to his term, and one can say, whoever serves
and serves not fully, he loses his reward.</p>
<h3>THE SIX POINTS OF SLOTH THAT BRING MAN TO HIS END.</h3>
<p>And yet again there are six evil points whereby sloth
brings man to his end. The first is disobedience, when the
man will not do what one tells him in penance; or (when)
one commands him something that seems to him hard, he
excuses himself that he cannot do it; or if he receives it,
he does it either little or naught. The second point is impatience;
for as he can bear nothing in the way of obedience,
he cannot endure in the way of patience, so that
none dare speak to him of his good. The third is murmuring,
for when one speaks to him for his good, he is angry
and murmurs, and thinks that one despises him, and therefrom
he falls into sorrow, which is the fourth vice. And
the same sorrow overcomes him so much that all that one
says to him, all that one does to him, all that he hears, all
that he sees, it all annoys him, and so he falls into sorrow
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
and into disinclination to live, so that he himself hastens
and desires his death; and this is the fifth vice. After all
these sorrowful points of sloth the devil gives him the
deadly stroke, and brings him to despair. Therefore, he
compasses his death and slays himself, as desperate and
gives himself to all evils, and dreads not to do sin, whatever
it be. To such an end sloth leads the man. These
are eighteen points that the devil throws upon the slothful;
it is no wonder though he lose the game.</p>
<h3>THE FIFTH HEAD OF THE BEAST.</h3>
<p>The fifth head of the beast before mentioned is the sin
of avarice and of covetousness, which is the root of all evil,
as says St. Paul. That is the mistress who has so large a
school that all go therein to learn, as says the Scripture.
For all manner of folk study in avarice, both great and
small: kings, prelates, clerks, both lay and religious.
Avarice is inordinate love, so inordinate it shows itself in
three ways generally, in winning boldly, in withholding
straitly, in spending niggardly. These are the three
principal boughs which grow from this root.</p>
<p>But specially and properly from the root of avarice go out
many small roots, which are very great, deadly sins. The
first is usury, the second theft, the third robbery, the
fourth false claim, the fifth sacrilege, the sixth simony, the
seventh wickedness, the eighth is in chaffer, the ninth is
wicked craft, the tenth is in evil folk, and each of these
small roots divides in many ways.</p>
<p>Then the first root, which is usury, divides into seven
outcastings. For there are seven kinds of usurers: lending,
who lend silver for others, and, above the principal, take
the profits, either in pence, or in horses, or in corn, or in
wine, or in fruit of the ground, which they take in mortgage,
without reckoning the fruit in payment, and what is
worse, they will reckon twice or thrice (in) the year in
order to make the usury increase, and will yet have gifts
over and above for each term, and often make of the usury
a principal debt. These are usurers evil and foul. But
there is another lender, courteous, who lends without
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
bargain-making, always for profit, either in pence, or in
horses, or in cups of gold or of silver, or robes, or tuns with
wine, or in fat swine, material services of horses, of carts, or
food, to them or to their children, or in other things, and
everywhere for usury, when one takes it by reason of the
loan. The second kind of usury is in those that lend not
to their parson, but what their fathers and the fathers
of their wives or their elders have obtained by usury they
withhold, and will not give it up. The third kind of
usury is in them that have shame to lend with their own
hand; but they cause their servants or other men to lend of
their pence. These are the master usurers. Of the same
sin the great men are not quit, who support and sustain
Jews and the Saracens, who lend and destroy the country,
and they take payments and great gifts, and sometimes the
ransoms that are for the goods of the poor. The fourth
kind is in them that lend of other men&rsquo;s silver, or take in
pledge at little cost in order to lend at greater cost. These
are like usurers that learn such foul craft. The fifth kind
is in unfair dealing: when one sells the thing, whatever it
be, for more than it is worth at the time, and what is
worse, the dishonest time-setter, when he sees the folk
most necessitous, then will he sell twice as dear as the
thing is worth. Such folk do too much evil. By means of
their time-setting they destroy and make beggars the
knights and the nobles that follow the tournaments, who
assign their lands and their heritage in pledge of mortgage,
which is not paid. Another sins in buying things, as
corn or wine or other thing(s for) less by half than it is
worth, for the pence which he pays at first, and then sells
it them again twice or thrice as dear. Another buys
things when they are worth least (and) very abundant
(<i>or</i> a great bargain), corn in harvest, wine in vintage
(vendage <i>in Glossary</i>), or wares, in order to sell again,
(and keeps them) until they are most dear, and desires the
dear time in order to sell the dearer. Another (buys)
corn in grass, vines in bloom, when they are of fair appearance,
by such a bargain that they may have, whatever
chance befall, their property safe. The sixth kind is of
those that take their pence to merchants, so that they may
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
be partakers in the winning and not in the loss, or who entrust
their beasts, as many as half, (to them,) so that they
may be of high price; that is to say, that if they die in the
meantime [they have to] put others in their stead worth as
much. The seventh kind is in those that do [this] to their
poor neighbours in their needs&mdash;(and) because they have lent
them a little silver or corn, or done some kindness, (and)
when they see them poor and needy, then make they a
bargain with them to do their jobs, and the pence that they
delivered before to the poor man, or lent him a little corn,
they have three pennyworths of work for one penny.</p>
<h3>THE SECOND BOUGH OF COVETOUSNESS.</h3>
<p>The second bough of avarice is theft; that is, to take or
withhold other men&rsquo;s things wrongfully, and without the
knowledge and will of the owner. And that one may do
in four ways after the manner of thieves. For there is
a thief open and a thief hidden, a thief privy and a
fellow-thief.</p>
<p>The thief common and open are those that by such craft
live, on whom one does judgment when one takes them.
Of such there are many kinds on land and on sea. The
hidden thief is he that steals in corners and secretly, great
things or little by (their) fighting, or by treason, or by
cunning.</p>
<p>The privy thieves are those that steal not of strangers,
but of private persons. And of such there are of great and
of small. The great are the sinful and dishonest reeves,
provosts, beadles and constables, that steal the fines and
withhold the revenue of their lords, and reckon more in
deeds and in expenditure, and less in receipts and in
revenue. Such are the great officials that are in the house
of rich men, that make great outlays, and give liberally the
goods of their lords without their knowledge and without
their will.</p>
<p>To this sin belong the sins of the wife, that does so much
by her sin that the children, that she knows well that she
has by adultery, bear away the legitimacy. Such is
the sin of the wife that steals the goods of her lord in
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
order to give to her kin, or to put to sinful use; and of
them of religion that are owners, for they promise to live
without possession.</p>
<p>The others are the little thieves, that steal in the house
bread, wine and other things, whatever they may be; or of
their neighbours, their capons, hens, fruit of their gardens,
or other things, whatever it may be. Such are those that
withhold the things that they find, and know well whose
they are, and will not give them up. For if thou findest
and restorest not, thou stealest it. And though they know
not whose they are, they shall not therefore withhold it,
but they shall act by the advice of holy Church or that of
their father confessors.</p>
<p>The thieves in fellowship are those that share in the
theft, either because of partnership, or by gift, or by
buying, or in other ways; afterwards those that consent, or
advise, or command to do it. And those that excuse the
thieves, or support them in their wickedness, or receive
them into their house, or into his land, with their theft;
afterwards the wicked judges that suffer them, either
through gifts, or through entreaties, or for other evil
cause, and will not, or dare not, do right.</p>
<h3>THE THIRD BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The third bough of avarice is robbery, which hath many
small roots. The first is in evil executors of bequests.
The second is in evil lords, be he knight or other, that
fleece the poor men that they should protect, by tolls, by
duties on corn and cattle (<i>read</i> coruees), by loans, by evil
customs, by lines, by threatenings, or by other customs that
they seek or bethink how they may have of theirs. In
this sin are the great princes or barons that by their power
take cities, castles, lands, baronies, and the other rich men
that rob their poor neighbours by force of lands, vines, or
other things, and take on the right hand and on the left,
so that nothing can escape them. The third is in robbers
and evil innkeepers, that rob the pilgrims and the
merchants and other wayfaring men. The fourth is in
them that will not pay what they must, and that withhold
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
wrongfully the wages of their servants, or of them that
attend to their needs. The fifth is in these great prelates,
that deprive and rob their underlings by too much procuring,
or by some unlawful exactions, which they make in
too many ways. Those are the wolves that devour the
sheep. The sixth is in such reeves, provosts, beadles, or
official men, whatever they may be, as commit great
robberies and wrongs upon the poor, and buy great
heritages. There are so many other kinds of robberies,
which it would be a long business to tell, but some are
continued above that that is (here) related.</p>
<h3>THE FOURTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The fourth bough of avarice is false claiming; that is,
running upon others wrongfully: to this sin belong all the
fraud, all falsehoods, and all guile(s) that come in pleading.
In this learning Dame Avarice has many scholars, both of
clerks and of laymen, and especially seven kinds of folk
that all study thus. The first is the false plaintiffs, that
make false pleas, and seek false judges, and long time,
and false witnesses, false advocates, false letters, in order
to grieve others and oppress the people wrongfully, either
in a Christian court or in a secular court. The second are
the false fugitives that flee and [do] not what is right,
and seek exceptions and respites, in order to deprive
others of their own. The third is the false witnesses;
these make the false marriages; these steal the heritages,
(and) thus do so much evil and harm as none can amend;
and all this they do through their great covetousness.
The fourth is the false pleaders, that receive and sustain
wittingly false causes, and plead them for hire and for
gifts, which they take on the right hand and on the left,
and often lose good suits by their sin, or because of
ignorance or through sloth turn aside the rights and do all
the wrongs on account of their covetousness, as those that
are masters of guile and of dispute and of false accusation.
The fifth is the false notaries that make false letters and
forge the seals, make wicked libels and too many other
falsehoods. The next is the false judges, that incline more
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
to one side than another through gifts or through promises
or through entreaties, or for love or for anger or for dread,
and unbind suits wrongfully; and have great costs made,
and take great gifts, sometimes from the one, sometimes
from the other, sometimes from both, and sell their
judgments, or let them come to nothing; and do poor men
great harm, which they cannot amend. The last are the
evil assessors, that give evil advice to the judges, and cause
suits to be lost on account of the services that they give.
All the persons before mentioned are bound to give up
what they have had wrongfully of others, and the harm
that others have had by them.</p>
<h3>THE FIFTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The fifth bough of avarice is sacrilege. Sacrilege is when
one breaks or injures, or takes away foully, the holy things,
or the men of holy Church, or the hallowed places that
are appropriated to God&rsquo;s service, and that often cause
covetousness in many ways. First, when one takes away
foully the body of our Lord, as do the heretics and the
witches and the wicked priests, in order to make gain.
Also I speak of the other sacraments. Afterwards, when
one breaks, or steals, or takes away foully, the hallowed
things, the crosses, the chalices, the chrism, the fine linen,
the consecrated vestments, and other consecrated things.
Afterwards, when one burns or breaks churches, or holy
places, church-towns, or religious houses, or when one takes
those out that flee to holy Church, or into church-towns,
in order to be protected. Afterwards, when one makes
quarrels in church so that there is blood shed, or when one
commits sin of lechery. Afterwards when one lays hands
wickedly on clerk, or on man or on woman of religion.
Afterwards, when one steals, or carries out of the holy place
for an evil cause consecrated things or unconsecrated,
whatever it may be. Of these sins those are not quit that
spend the goods of holy Church, the patrimony of Jesu
Christ, for an evil purpose, nor those any the more that
steal, or withhold by wrong or by force, or hide the things
that are appropriated to holy Church, or pay them badly, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
the rents, the offerings, the tithes, and the other rights of
holy Church. Of this same sin those are not quit that
break Sundays, and the feasts that are to be observed. For
the holy day has its freedom, as have the holy places.
These are the small boughs that grow from the bough of
sacrilege.</p>
<h3>THE SIXTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The sixth bough of avarice is simony, which is so named
because of a wizard, that was called Simon, who wished to
buy of St. Peter the Apostle the grace to do miracles, and
offered great wealth, and therefore all those are called
Simoniacs, that will sell or buy spiritual things, which is,
among all the deadly sins, one of the greatest. And this
bough has many twigs. The first is in them that sell or
buy the holy orders, or the body of our Lord, or the other
sacraments of holy Church. The second is in them that sell
God&rsquo;s Word, and preach principally for pence. The third is
in them that by gifts, or by promises, or by entreaties
dreadful or carnal, prevail so far that they or others are
chosen to dignities of holy Church, such as bishoprics,
abbeys, or deaneries, or other dignities that one fills by
election. The fourth is in them that through gifts, or
through promises, or through terrible entreaties, or through
unclean service, give the prebends and the parishes, or
other benefices of holy Church. The fifth is in them that
by bargain-making let or change their benefices. The sixth
is in them that by bargain-making go into religion, and in
them that in such manner receive them.</p>
<p>Many other sins there are, and of divers cases, in simony.
But they belong more to clerks than to laymen. And this
book is made more for laymen than for clerks who have
books. But always it is necessary for laymen that they
should keep themselves from this sin in three cases. One is
when they will help their kin or their friends to rise in
dignities of holy Church. The second when they give prebends
or benefices that are in their gift. The third when
they yield their children to religion. In these three
points, if they give or receive gifts or evil entreaties or evil
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
services, they might soon fall into this sin of simony. For,
as say the holy writings, there are three kinds of gifts that
make simony: gift of land, gift of mouth, as entreaties, gift
of uncleanly service. I call uncleanly when the services are
done for an uncleanly cause, or principally for a spiritual
matter.</p>
<h3>THE SEVENTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The seventh bough of avarice is wickedness. I call
wickedness, when the man is so wicked and such a devil,
that he dreads not to do a great sin, deadly and horrible,
or great harm to others, for a little gain or for advantage
to himself. This bough has many twigs. The first is when
any for dread of poverty or for covetousness, in order to
make gain, forsakes (denies) God and the Christian belief,
and becomes a Bulgar, or Jew, or Saracen. To this sin
belongs the sin of them that for pence have the devil summoned,
and make enchantments, and cause to look into a
sword or into the nail of the thumb, in order to overtake
thieves or for other things. And of them also that cause or
obtain by charms or by witchcraft or by evil, whatever it be,
that folk that are in wedlock together hate one another, or
cannot have fellowship the one with the other in wedlock; or
that folk, that are not in wedlock, love one another foolishly
and in sin. The second is the sin of grudging and of treason
(fraud), when the man for gain or for reward doth thing(s)
whereby they lead others to death, either by sword, or by
poison, or in other way, whatever it may be. The third is
the sin of them that for gain burn houses, towns, castles,
cities, or churches, or destroy the vines, or corn, or do other
harm for reward. The fourth is the sin of them that sow
discord, and obtain strife and wars in cities, or in capitals,
or between the nobles, because they think to gain more
with strife in war than in peace. The fifth is the sin of
reeves, of provosts, of beadles, of servants, that accuse and
challenge poor folk, and cause them to be charged, and use
them ill, for a little gain that they have besides.</p>
<p>To this sin belongs the sin of false judges, and of false
advocates, and of false witnesses, of whom we have spoken
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
above. In many other ways the sin of wickedness is done.
But it were a long business to tell, and better may each man
read the same sin and the others in the book of his conscience,
than in any sheepskin.</p>
<h3>THE EIGHTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The eighth bough of avarice is unfair dealing, wherein
one sins in many ways for temporal gain, and especially in
seven ways. The first is to sell things as dear as one can,
and to buy as cheap as one can. The second is lying,
swearing, and forswearing, the dearer to sell their chaffer.
The third way is what one does in weights and measures,
and that may be in three ways. The first when one has
diverse weights or diverse measures, and buys by the
greatest weights or by the greatest measures, and sells by
the least. The second way is when one has just weights
and just measures, and sells dishonestly, as do these tavern-keepers
that fill the measure with scum. The third way is
when those that sell by weight so procure and cause that
the thing that one shall weigh shows more heavy. The
fourth way to sin in unfair dealing is to sell to time; of
this we have spoken above. The fifth way is to sell another
thing than one is shown before, as do these scriveners that
show a good letter at the beginning and afterwards make a
bad one. The sixth is to hide the truth about the thing
that one will sell, as do the fraudulent dealers. The seventh
is to cause (to procure) that the thing that one sells seems
to have a better appearance than it has, as do these sellers
of cloth that choose dark places, where they sell their cloth.
In many other ways one may sin in unfair dealings, but it
would be a long matter to tell.</p>
<h3>THE NINTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The ninth bough of avarice is in evil crafts. In this
sin much folk in many ways; as these foolish women, that
for a little gain give themselves to sin: also these heralds
and these champions and many others, that for pence or for
temporal profit give themselves to dishonest craft, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
cannot be done without sin, both of those that do it and of
those that support them.</p>
<h3>THE TENTH BOUGH OF AVARICE.</h3>
<p>The tenth bough of avarice is evil games, such as games
of dice and of tables and others, whatever they may be,
where one plays for pence or for other temporal gain. Such
evil games, especially of dice and of tables, are forbidden by
right because of many sins that follow such games. The
first is covetousness, to win, and to despoil his fellow. The
second is too great usury, as nine for twelve, not for a month,
nor for eight days, but in one self-same day. The third is
to increase lies and idle words and, what is worse, great
blasphemies of God and of His saints, wherefore God is
angry, as oftentimes He has taken too little vengeance. For
sometimes their visage turns round, with the front behind.</p>
<h3><i>A Tale.</i></h3>
<p>There was a knight that swore by God&rsquo;s eyes; in haste his
one eye leapt upon the checker. An archer, because he had
lost at gambling, took his bow and shot upwards at God. In
the morning, when he sat at play, his arrow fell upon the
checker all bloody.</p>
<p>The fourth is the evil example, which he that plays gives
to others that see the game. The fifth is loss of time that one
should occupy in good works. And many other sins which it
were a long matter to tell. One thing I shall not forget, that
he that wins cannot well withhold what he wins, but shall give
it for God&rsquo;s love, except it be in such a way that he had it
by fraud or by force, like him that by force causes others to
play. In that case he should restore it to him that has lost
it. Also I speak of what one wins at a tournament.</p>
<p>These are the boughs of avarice: there are enough others.
But they are more for clerks than for laymen. And this
book is made more for laymen than for clerks, who know
the writings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h3>THE SIXTH HEAD OF THE BEAST.</h3>
<p>The sixth head of the evil beast is lechery; that is, excessive
and inordinate love, in lust of loins or in fleshly lust.
As regards this sin the devil tempts in five ways, as says St.
Gregory. First in foolish sight, afterwards in foolish words,
afterwards in foolish handling, afterwards in foolish kissing,
afterwards one comes to the deed. For from foolish sight
one comes to the speech, and from the speech to the handling,
from the handling to the kissing, from the kissing to
the deed. And thus subtlely the devil makes (one) go from
one to another. This sin divides first into two kinds, for
there is lechery of heart and lechery of body. The lechery
of heart has four steps. For the spirit of fornication, which
attends on the fire of lechery, embraces the hearts; first
makes the thoughts come, and the delights, and the imaginations
of sin to the heart, and makes (it) think. Afterwards
the heart dwells on the thoughts, and so is delighted; yet
it does not the deed for anything. And in this dwelling
and in the same lust is the second step, which may be deadly
sin. The great sin may be the lust. The third step is the
consenting of heart, and of the reason, and of the will. And
such consentings are always deadly sin. After the consenting
comes the desire and the great heat that they have to
sin, and do more than twenty sins in the day, in sight of
ladies and of maidens, who show themselves fairly adorned,
who often show and adorn themselves the more quaintly and
the more beautifully in order to make fools wonder at them,
and think not to sin greatly because they have no will to do
the deed. But forsooth they sin very grievously. For by
reason of them are many souls lost. And there is much
folk brought to death and to sin. For, as says the proverb,
&lsquo;Lady of fair adorning is arbalest to the tower.&rsquo; For she
has not a limb in her body that is not a trap of the devil, as
Solomon says. Then it behoves at the day of judgment to
give account of the souls that by reason of them are lost:
that is to say, when they give occasion to sin wittingly.</p>
<p>Lechery of body is divided into lechery of eyes, of ears,
of mouth, of hands, and of all the senses of the body, and
especially of the foul deed. And how is it a foul deed since
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
it is natural? Because God forbids it in His Gospel, and
His Apostle Paul, who thus says: &lsquo;Let each man have his
own, because of fornication;&rsquo; that is to say, his own wife.
To that sin belong all the things whereby the flesh rises and
desires such a deed, such as the great drinkers and eaters,
the soft bed, pleasant clothes, and all manner of ease of body
unnecessarily, and especially idleness.</p>
<p>The sin of the deed of lechery is divided into many
boughs according to the state of the persons that do it, and
goes upwards from bad to worse. The first is of man or of
woman that have no bond, either of widowhood, or of wedlock,
or of orders, or of religion, or of another kind. That
is the first deadly sin in the deed of lechery. The second is
with a common woman. This sin is harder because it (she)
is older, and because such women are sometimes wives, or
(women) of religion, and forsake no one, neither father, nor
brother, nor son, nor kin. The third is of a single man with
a widow, or the converse. The fourth is with a single
woman. The fifth is with a married woman; that is the sin
of adultery, which is very wrong, because there is breaking
of troth, which the one shall bear to the other; afterwards
there is a sacrilege, when one breaks the sacrament of
marriage; sometimes desertion of heir befalls, and false
marriages. This sin is sometimes doubled, when it is of a
married man with a woman that has a husband. The sixth
is when the man, (that) has his own wife, does a thing that
is forbidden and inordinate, against the nature of man and
orders and marriage. And with his own sword a man may
slay himself. Also he may with his own wife sin deadly.
Therefore God smote to an evil death Onan, Jacob&rsquo;s nephew.
And the devil that was called Asmodeus strangled the seven
husbands of the holy maid, Sara, who was afterwards the
wife of young Tobias. For all the sacraments of holy
Church one shall use cleanlily and with great honour. The
seventh is of a man with his godmother or with his goddaughter,
or of a godson with the children of his sponsors,
for those children cannot come together without deadly sin,
not even in marriage. The eighth is of a man with his kin,
and the same sin is increased and lessened according as the
kinship is near or far. The ninth is of the man with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
kin of his wife, or, on the contrary, of the wife with the kin
of her husband. The same sin is very dreadful. For when
the man hath fellowship with any woman, he can no longer
in marriage have any of her kin, and if he takes any the
marriage is naught. And if he takes a wife and afterwards
[another woman] on the side of her kin, he loses the right
that he had to his wife, inasmuch as she may not afterwards
dwell with him, except she beg for it before. The
tenth is of women with hooded clerks. This sin is increased
and lessened according to the hoods and the esteem. The
eleventh is of a man of the world with a woman of religion,
or, on the contrary, of a woman of the world with a man of
religion. The twelfth is of a man of religion and a woman
of religion, and this sin is increased and lessened according
to the state of the persons that do it. The thirteenth is of
prelates, who should be a pattern and example of holiness
and of cleanness to all the world. The last is most foul and
most loathsome, which is not to be named. The same
sin is against nature, which the devil teaches to man or to
woman in many ways, which are not to be named because
of the matter, which is too abominable. But in shrift the
same shall name it, to whom it is befallen. For as much
more foul and more horrible the sin is, the more shrift
avails. For the shame that one has in the telling is a great
part of the penance. This sin is so hateful to God that He
did rain burning fire and stinking brimstone upon the city
of Sodom, and of Gomorrah, and caused five cities to sink
into hell. The devil himself, who brings it about, has shame
when man does it, and the air is envenomed with the deed.</p>
<h3>THE SEVENTH HEAD OF THE BEAST.</h3>
<p>The seventh head of the evil beast is the sin of the mouth;
and because the mouth has two offices, whereof the one
belongs to the swallow, as to meat and to drink, the other
is in speech; therefore the same sin is divided principally
into two parts: to wit, into the sin of gluttony, which is in
meat and in drink; and into the sin of an evil tongue, that
is, foolish speaking. And first let us speak of the sin of
gluttony, which is a vice that the devil is much pleased with,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and (which) much displeases God. Through such sin has
the devil very great power over man. Whereof we read in
the Gospel, that God gave the devils leave to go into the
swine, and when they were in them (they) drowned them in
the sea, as a sign that gluttons lead the life of swine, and
the devil has leave to go into them, and drown them in the
sea of hell, and to cause them to eat so much that they
burst asunder, and to drink so much that they drown themselves.</p>
<p>When the champion has felled his man and holds him by
the throat, with great difficulty he arises. And so it is with
those that the devil holds through sin, and therefore
blithely he runs at the throat, like the wolf to the sheep, in
order to strangle him, as he did to Eve and to Adam in the
terrestrial paradise. That is the fisherman of hell, who
takes the fish by the throat and by the chin. This sin
much displeases God. For the glutton works too great a
shame when he makes his god of a sack full of dung, that is,
of his belly, which he loves more than God, and in it remains,
and serves it. God commands him to fast; the belly
says: &lsquo;Thou shalt not, but eat long and continuously.&rsquo; God
commands him in the morning to arise; the belly says:
&lsquo;Thou shalt not; I am too full, it behoves me to sleep;
the church is no hare, it can well await me.&rsquo; And when
he arises, he begins his matins and his prayers and his
orisons, and says: &lsquo;Ah, God! what shall we eat to-day?
whether one shall find anything that is worth (eating)?&rsquo;
After these matins come the praises, and he says: &lsquo;Ah,
God! lo, we had good wine yester evening and good meats.&rsquo;
And after that he beweeps his sins and says: &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; he
says: &lsquo;I have been nigh dead to-night; too strong was that
wine last evening. My head aches; I shall not be at ease
until I have drunk.&rsquo; Thus, too, the evil man says. This sin
leads man to shame. For first of all he becomes a tavern-goer,
then he plays at dice, then he sells his own, then he
becomes ribald, a whoremonger and thief, and then one
hangs him. This is the scot (payment) that one often pays.</p>
<p>This sin is divided, as by St. Gregory, into five boughs.
For in five ways one sins by meat and by drink; either in
that one eats and drinks before time, or too greedily, or out
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
of measure, or too ardently, or too plenteously. The first
bough, then, of this sin is to eat before time, and too foul a
thing it is of a man that has age when he cannot wait for
the time to eat; and of great lechery of throat it comes that
a man who is strong and whole of body without reasonable
cause yearns for meat before the right hour, as does a dumb
beast. And many sins come of the same habit. Then it
comes about that such a man says, that he cannot fast or do
penance; for he has said this: &lsquo;I have too bad a head.&rsquo;
And he says true, for he has made it such, and an evil heart
also, which that sin has made, and has caused him to break
the fasts, which is a great sin. And if he damned himself
by himself, thereof no matter; but he will have fellows,
that do as he does, whom he draws from well-doing, and
leads them with him into hell. For he causes them to break
their fasts and do their gluttonies, wherefrom they would
keep themselves, if there were no evil companions. For
the drinker and the whoremonger, among the other evils
that they do, [commit] one sin that is properly the devil&rsquo;s,
when they withdraw [others] from well-doing. They say
that they cannot fast, but they lie. For little love of God
possesses them that I speak of. For if they loved the true
joy of heaven as much as they do the idle bliss of this world,
as they fast because of temporal needs until night, as well
might they fast until noon for God, if they loved Him so
much. But they are just like the child that will always
have the bread in his hand. And thou shalt know that as
one sins by too early rising in order to eat, so also one sins
in supping late. The folk, then, that love to sup late, and
to keep awake at night, and waste the time in idleness, and
go late to bed and rise late, sin in many ways. First, in
that they waste the time and misspend it, when they make
of the night day and of the day night. Such folk God
accurses by the prophet. For one shall by day do good, and
by night praise God and pray; but whoever lies abed when
he should arise, sleep he must when he should pray, and his
service hear, and praise God; and thus he loses all his time,
both by night and by day. Afterwards in such vigils one
does many evils, as play at chess or at games of hazard, and
one says much scorn and folly, and thus the wretch wastes
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
his time and his wits and his goods, and angers God, and
harms his body, and still more his soul.</p>
<p>The second bough is excess and want of moderation in
meat and in drink. The same are properly gluttons, who
devour all, as does the kite with his sparrow. There is
great sense in observing moderation in meat and in drink,
and great health, for many people die, and often there come
great sicknesses. But whoever will learn this moderation,
he shall know and understand that there are many ways of
living in the world. The first lives by the flesh, the second
by his jollity, the third by his physic, the fourth by his
honesty, the fifth by what his (their) sins require, the sixth
by the spirit and by the love of God.</p>
<p>Those that live by the flesh, as says St. Paul, slay their
souls, for they make their god of their belly. The same
observe neither reason nor measures, and therefore they shall
have in the other world torment without measure.</p>
<p>Those that live by their jollity will keep their foolish
fellowships, so that they neither know how, nor are able to
observe measure.</p>
<p>Those that live by hypocrisy, who are the devil&rsquo;s martyrs,
have two measures, for the two devils that torment the
hypocrite are much opposed to each other. The one says to
him: &lsquo;Eat enough, until thou art fair and fat;&rsquo; the other
says to him: &lsquo;Thou shalt not, but thou shalt fast until thou
art pale and lean.&rsquo; Now, it behoves to have two measures,
one little and (one) scant that he uses before people; and
another good and liberal, which he uses so that none sees;
this holds not the right measure. He whom covetousness
leads has such a measure as the purse wills, who is lady and
hostess of the house. Then shall we between the purse and
the belly of the glutton have a fair strife. The belly says:
&lsquo;I will be full;&rsquo; the purse says: &lsquo;I will be full.&rsquo; The belly
says: &lsquo;I will that thou eat and drink, and that thou spend.&rsquo;
And the purse says: &lsquo;Thou shalt not; I will that thou keep
and retrench.&rsquo; Alas! what shall he do, this wretch who is
thrall to two such evil lords? Two measures make the
wight mad: the measure of the belly, in other men&rsquo;s house
good and liberal; and the measure of the purse, of her who
is sorrowful and sparing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Those that live by physic observe the measure of Hippocrates,
which is little and narrow; and it often befalls that
he that by physic lives by physic dies.</p>
<p>Those that live by their honesty, the same observe the
measure of reason and live honourably to the world, who
eat at the time and at the hour, and take with goodwill
what they have both courteously and gladly.</p>
<p>Those that live by what their sins demand observe such
manner and measure as one enjoins on them in penance.</p>
<p>Those that live by the Spirit are those that dwell in the
love of God, whom the Holy Ghost teaches to observe order
and reason and measure; those that have control over their
bodies, who is so taught that he asks for no extraordinary
thing, and does what the Spirit commands without murmuring
and without contradiction.</p>
<p>Now canst thou see, from what we have said here, that
the devil has many gins to take people by the throat; for
first he shows them wines and meats that are fair and
pleasant, as he did the apple to Eve. And if that avails
not, he says to him: &lsquo;Eat and drink like so and so and so
and so; it behoves thee to keep fellowship, if thou wilt that
one should not starve thee, nor esteem thee a hypocrite;&rsquo;
or he says to him: &lsquo;The health of thy body thou shalt
look after, for whoever hath not health hath naught. Be
not thine own manslayer; thou owest to thy body sustenance.&rsquo;
Or he says to him: &lsquo;Take heed to the good things
that thou dost or mayest do; thou eatest not for the lust of
thy body, but to serve God; thou shalt keep thy strength
for God, as David says.&rsquo; These reasons are so convincing
that the wisest and holiest man is sometimes beguiled.</p>
<p>The third bough of this sin is to run hastily after meat,
as does the hound after the hare; and the greater the haste
is, the greater is the sin. For as it is no sin to have riches,
but to love them too much; just so it is no sin to eat good
meats, but to eat them too hastily or immoderately. To
eat meats is good for the good, and for them that use them
in reason and in measure, and take them with the sauce of
the dread of our Lord. For one shall evermore have dread
lest one mistake through excess, and one shall praise God
and yield Him thanks for His gifts. And by the sweetness
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
of the meat, which otherwise cannot be, one shall think of
God&rsquo;s sweetness and of that meat which fills the heart.
Therefore one reads in a religious house at meat, in order
that when the body takes its meat on the one hand the
heart should take its on the other hand.</p>
<p>The fourth bough of this sin is of those that will live too
nobly, who spend and waste, in order to fill (up the measure
of) their gluttony, (that) whereby a hundred poor might live
and sufficiently be filled. Such folk sin in many ways.
First, in the great spendings that they make; afterwards in
that they use it in too great heat and in too great lust; and
afterwards in the idle bliss that they have. For it is not
only lechery of taste, but it is very often for boasting that
they seek such rich meats and make so many messes, whereof
come often many evils.</p>
<p>The fifth bough is the anxiety of gluttons, who seek only
the delight of their swallow. These are properly lechers,
who seek only the lust of their swallow. In three things
especially lies the sin of such folk. First, in the great
anxiety that they have to purchase and to prepare; afterwards,
in the great lust that they have in the use; afterwards,
in the bliss that they have in the recalling. And
who (is there) that could tell what trouble they take in
order that their meats may be well prepared, and each to
his own smack, and how they may make of one meat many
disguised messes because of their foul lust. And when the
messes are come, one after the other, then are (there) jests
and trifles for <i>entrements</i>, and in this manner goes the time.
The wretch forgets himself, reason sleeps, the stomach (in
complaint) cries and says: &lsquo;Dame Swallow, thou slayest
me; I am so full that I burst asunder.&rsquo; But the tongue,
the lickster, answers him and says: &lsquo;Though thou shouldst
burst asunder, I will not let this mess escape.&rsquo; After the
lechery that is in eating comes the bliss that is in him who
recalls (it). Afterwards they wish that they had the necks
of a crane and the belly of a cow, in order that the morsels
might remain longer in the throat, and (that they) might
devour more.</p>
<p>Now thou hast heard the sins that come of gluttony and
of lechery. And because such sins arise commonly in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
tavern, which is a well of sin, therefore I will touch a little
upon the sins that are done in the tavern. The tavern is
the school of the devil, where his disciples study, and his
own chapel, where one performs his service, and where he
does his miracles, such as it behoves the devil (to do). At
church God can show His virtues and do His miracles, to
give sight to the blind, to make the crooked straight, to
restore the wits of the mad, speech to the dumb, hearing to
the deaf. But the devil does all, on the contrary, in the
tavern. For when the glutton goes into the tavern, he goes
upright; when he comes out, he has not a foot that can
sustain or bear him. When he goes therein, he sees and
hears and speaks well and understands; when he comes out,
he has lost all this, just like one that has not wit or reason
or understanding. Such are the miracles that the devil
does. And what lessons he reads there! All filth he
teaches there, gluttony, lechery, swearing, forswearing; to
lie, to slander, to deny God, to misreport, to dispute, and
too many other kinds of sins. There arise chidings, strifes,
manslaughters; there one teaches to steal and to be hanged.
The tavern is a ditch to thieves, and the devil&rsquo;s castle in
order to war against God and His saints; and those that
sustain the taverns are sharers in all the sins that are done
in their taverns; and forsooth if one said or did as much
shame to their father or to their mother or to their lads, as
one does to their heavenly Father and to our Lady and to
the saints of paradise, they would grow very angry and
take other counsel in regard to it than they do.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
